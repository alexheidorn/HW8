The best way to combine 2 heaps is to create a new array of size n1 + n2 and put the elements from both
arrays into the new one and then call heapify on the entire array. This operation costs O(N).
This is the best option because it will be tough to combine two heaps in the specific heap order
with 2 heaps of wildly varying sizes. This method doesn't care how big either array are and 
only calls heapify N/2 times from the last parent node on up.

pseudo code:
{
    heap1[n1]
    heap2[n2]

    newheap[n1 + n2]

    add elelemnts from heap1 & heap2 into newheap

    call heapify on newheap from final parent element and up.
}
